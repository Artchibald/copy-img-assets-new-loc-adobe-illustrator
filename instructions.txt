This script only works locally not on a server. 

Don't forget to change .txt to .js on the script.

This script relates to this other script: https://github.com/Artchibald/2022_icon_rebrand_scripts. It is an addon built on top to run a batch export of the 800x500 no text. 

  Video set up tutorial available here: https://youtu.be/XXXXXXXXXXXXXX. 

Open Illustrator but don't open a document. 

Go to file > Scripts > Other Scripts > Import our new script. 

Illustrator says(not responding) on PC but it will respond, give Bill Gates some time XD!). 

 If you run the script again, you should probably delete the previous assets created.They get intermixed and overwritten. 

Both artboard sizes of 1 and 2 must be exactly 256px x 256px. 

Guides must be on a layer called exactly 'Guidelines'. 

Icons must be on a layer called exactly 'Art'. 

Make sure all layers are unlocked to avoid bugs. 

Exported assets will be saved where the.ai file is saved. 

Please try to use underscore instead of spaces to avoid bugs in filenames. 

Make sure you are using the correct swatches / colours. 

Illustrator check advanced colour mode is correct: Edit > Assign profile > Must match sRGB IEC61966 - 2.1. 

Select each individual color shape and under Window > Colours make sure each shape colour is set to rgb in tiny top right burger menu if bugs encountered. 

If it does not save exports as intended, check the file permissions of where the.ai file is saved(right click folder > Properties > Visibility > Read and write access ? Also you can try apply permissions to sub folders too if you find that option)
